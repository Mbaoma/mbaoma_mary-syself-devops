## Architecture for your companyâ€™s new self-managed Kubernetes environment
The environment's requirements are
- Ubuntu 24.04 as the base OS
- Kubernetes version must be v1.30.3

### Layers of a Kubernetes Environment
- Infrastructure Layer
- Control Plane Layer
- Worker Node Layer
- Networking Layer
- Storage Layer
- Security Layer
- Monitoring and Logging Layer

#### Infrastructure Layer
By implementing Kubernetes in this tier, you establish a group of operational machines (nodes) capable of executing your applications packaged in containers. In this scenario, we are presented with
- Ubuntu 24.04, the foundational operating system for the virtual machines (VMs).
- Kubernetes version v1.30.3

#### Control Plane Layer
This layer is responsible for overseeing the Kubernetes cluster. It is made up of these parts:
- The API Server: checks and sets up data for API elements like pods, services, and replication controllers.
- etcd: functions as a reliable and constantly accessible key-value repository that serves as Kubernetes' storage solution for cluster information.
- Controller Manager: integrates the primary control loops included in Kubernetes.
- The scheduler: guarantees that Pods are assigned to Nodes, for Kubelet to execute them.

#### Worker Node Layer
This layer operates the application workloads. It is made up of these parts:
- kubelet: the main "node agent" on each node.
- kube-proxy: operates on every node within a Kubernetes cluster and functions as a network proxy.
- Container Runtime: oversees the operation and lifespan of containers in a Kubernetes setting like Docker and containerd.

#### Networking Layer
Clusters require a strong networking layer for pod communication and external access.
- Container Network Interface plugin (CNI): manages the network on which services operate.
- Ingress Controller: serves as a specialized load balancer for Kubernetes clusters.

#### Storage Layer
Stateful applications require dependable storage solutions.
- CSI (Container Storage Interface) is a way to handle storage systems, like EBS CSI which is used for AWS EKS.
- Persistent Volumes (PVs): supply storage to pods.
- Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs): pods request storage through them.

#### Security Layer
Security is incorporated at different levels to safeguard the cluster and its workloads.
- RBAC guarantees that cluster users and workloads can access the necessary resources for their assigned roles.
- Network Policies enable you to define the communication rules for a pod with different networks.
- ConfigMaps store data as key-value pairs while Secrets store data as base64-encoded data for an extra layer of security.

#### Monitoring and Logging Layer
Monitoring and logging are essential to maintain cluster health and troubleshooting.
- Prometheus gathers metrics in the form of time-series data.
- Grafana is an open-source visualization tool for viewing monitored metrics, logs, creating dashboards, and setting up alerts.
- The combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana - the ELK Stack.

## Deployment and Configuration
I will use Terraform to configure the various components of my Kubernetes cluster during the setup process.
Start the Control Plane with Bootstrap:
- Spin up virtual machines for control plane elements.
- Set up etcd, API server, controller manager, and scheduler.

Connect Worker Nodes:
- Establish virtual machines for the worker nodes.
- Configure kubelet, kube-proxy, and the container runtime.
- Connect the worker nodes to the cluster using kubeadm or a different tool.

Set up networking:
- Install CNI plugins to facilitate communication between pods.
- Configure the ingress controller to manage external traffic.

Set up storage:
- Set up and configure the CSI drivers.
- Generate storage classes, persistent volumes, and persistent volume claims as necessary.

Implementing security procedures:
- Set up RBAC rules to limit access.
- Define network policies to manage and regulate traffic flow.
- Utilize Secrets and ConfigMaps for confidential information.

Establish monitoring and logging.
- Configure Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the system.
- Use the ELK stack for centralized log management.

By adhering to this structure, I guarantee a Kubernetes environment that is scalable, secure, and maintainable, meeting all requirements while staying independent of any specific cloud platform.
